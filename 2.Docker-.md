**Docker overview**

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.

**Docker Commands**

1.docker version : Displays Docker version information, including the client and server versions.

2.docker info : Provides detailed information about the Docker installation, such as the number of containers, images, storage drivers, and more.

3.docker pull <image> : Downloads a Docker image from a registry (like Docker Hub) to your local machine. The image is used as a base for creating containers.

4.docker images : Lists all Docker images available on your local machine, along with their sizes and tags.

5.docker build -t <tag> <path> : Builds a Docker image from a Dockerfile located in the specified path and assigns it a given tag.

6.docker run <image> : Creates and starts a new container from the specified image. If the image is not available locally, Docker will try to pull it first.

7.docker ps : Lists all running containers along with their details, including container IDs, names, status, and ports.

8.docker ps -a : Lists all containers, including those that are not currently running.

9.docker exec -it <container> <command> : Runs a command inside a running container. The -it flag allows interaction with the command's input and output streams.

10.docker stop <container> : Stops a running container gracefully, giving it a chance to perform any necessary cleanup before shutting down.

11.docker start <container> : Starts a stopped container that was previously created but is not currently running.

12.docker restart <container> : Stops and then starts a container, effectively restarting it.

13.docker logs <container> : Displays the logs generated by a container, helping you troubleshoot issues or monitor application output.

14.docker rm <container> : Removes a stopped container. The -f flag can be used to force removal of a running container.

15.docker rmi <image> : Removes a Docker image from your local machine. The -f flag can be used to force removal of an image.

16.docker-compose up : Starts services defined in a docker-compose.yml file. It creates and starts containers for all services, based on the configurations provided.

17.docker-compose down : Stops and removes containers, networks, and volumes defined in a docker-compose.yml file.
