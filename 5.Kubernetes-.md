**Kubernetes overview**

Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

**Kubernetes main Components**

1.Master Components:
These components manage the overall Kubernetes cluster.
kube-apiserver: The API server exposes the Kubernetes API and is the entry point for all control operations in the cluster.
etcd: A distributed key-value store used to store configuration data and state information for the entire cluster.
kube-scheduler: Responsible for assigning pods to nodes based on resource availability and constraints.
kube-controller-manager: Runs various control loops that regulate the state of the system. Examples include node controller, replication controller, and service account controller.
cloud-controller-manager: Integrates the cluster with the cloud provider's API, handling features like node provisioning, load balancing, and storage management.

2.Node Components:
These components run on each node and manage the containers and their associated resources.
kubelet: Communicates with the API server to ensure that containers are running in a pod. It manages the containers' lifecycle, monitors their health, and takes actions based on the desired state.
kube-proxy: Maintains network rules to manage network connectivity to and from pods.
Container Runtime: The software responsible for running containers, such as Docker, containerd, or CRI-O.

3.Add-ons:
Add-ons provide additional features and functionality to the Kubernetes cluster.
DNS (CoreDNS): Provides DNS-based service discovery for pods and services in the cluster.
Dashboard: A web-based graphical user interface for managing and monitoring the cluster.
Ingress Controller: Manages external access to services within the cluster using HTTP and HTTPS routing rules.
Monitoring and Logging: Various tools like Prometheus and Fluentd are used for monitoring and logging applications.
Networking Solutions: Plugins like Calico, Flannel, and Weave provide network connectivity between pods and nodes.

4.Persistent Storage:
Kubernetes provides various options for persistent storage.
Persistent Volumes (PV): Abstracts physical storage resources and provides a way to attach and manage them within pods.
Persistent Volume Claims (PVC): A request for a specific amount of storage with specific access modes. PVCs are used by pods to request storage.

**Kubernets list of key resources and concepts in Kubernetes:**

1.CPU (Central Processing Unit) : Represents the processing power allocated to containers. Measured in CPU units or cores.Managed using requests and limits in pod specifications.

2.Memory : Represents the RAM allocated to containers.Measured in bytes, with common suffixes (e.g., Mi, Gi) for megabytes and gigabytes.Managed using requests and limits in pod specifications.

3.Storage : Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) manage storage resources.Allows data to persist beyond pod lifecycle.

4.Pods : The smallest deployable units in Kubernetes.Can contain one or more containers that share network and storage resources.

5.Deployments : Manage the deployment and scaling of pods.Support rolling updates and rollbacks.

6.Services : Provide network connectivity to a set of pods.Allow load balancing and service discovery.

7.ConfigMaps and Secrets : ConfigMaps store configuration data that can be consumed by pods.Secrets store sensitive data like passwords and tokens.

8.Namespaces : Logical isolation of cluster resources. Allows multiple teams or applications to share a single cluster.

9.Nodes : Physical or virtual machines that run containers. Managed by the Kubernetes control plane.

10.Control Plane Components : Consists of components like kube-apiserver, etcd, kube-scheduler, and kube-controller-manager.Manages the overall state of the cluster.

11.Network Policies : Define how pods are allowed to communicate with each other.Enforce security and network segmentation.

12.Volumes : Allows data to be shared and persisted between containers and pods.Various types include emptyDir, hostPath, and cloud provider-specific volumes.

13.Ingress : Manages external access to services within the cluster. Routes traffic based on rules and hostnames.

14.DaemonSets : Ensures that a specific pod runs on all (or specific) nodes in the cluster.Useful for system daemons or monitoring agents.

15.StatefulSets : Manages the deployment of stateful applications with unique network identities and persistent storage.

16.Horizontal Pod Autoscaling : Automatically adjusts the number of replicas in a Deployment or ReplicationController based on resource utilization.

17.Vertical Pod Autoscaling : Adjusts the resource requests and limits of pods based on observed usage.

18.Pod Disruption Budgets : Define the number of pods that can be disrupted during voluntary disruptions.

19.Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) : Extend the Kubernetes API to support custom resources and controllers.

20.Metrics and Monitoring : Kubernetes provides integration with monitoring tools like Prometheus for collecting cluster and application metrics.

**Deployment file**

A Deployment is a higher-level abstraction that manages the creation, scaling, and updating of replicas of your application's pods. It ensures that a specified number of replicas are running at all times, and it provides rolling updates for changes to your application's container images or configuration.

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-deployment
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-container
          image: my-image:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080

**Congigmap file**

A ConfigMap is used to store configuration data that can be consumed by pods or other resources within the cluster. This allows you to separate configuration from application code and manage it independently.

apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-configmap
  namespace: my-namespace
data:

**Service file**

Kubernetes Services are used to expose and access groups of pods in a consistent and reliable manner. A service file contains the configuration details needed to create and define the behavior of a service within the Kubernetes cluster.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
  type: ClusterIP

**Ingress file**

In Kubernetes, an Ingress is an API object that manages external access to services within your cluster. It provides a way to configure the routing of incoming HTTP and HTTPS traffic to different services based on hostnames and paths. An Ingress resource defines rules and settings for how traffic should be directed to backend services. To define these rules, you create an Ingress YAML file.

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  rules:
    - host: example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: my-service
                port:
                  number: 80

**Persistent Volume Claim**

 Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) is used to request a certain amount of storage from a Persistent Volume (PV), which is a cluster-level resource. PVCs abstract the underlying storage details and provide a way for applications to dynamically request storage resources without needing to know where or how the storage is provisioned

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: my-pvc
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce  # The access mode for the volume
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi   # The requested storage size

**Persistent Volume**

Persistent Volume (PV) is a cluster-level resource that represents a piece of storage in the cluster, such as a physical disk, a network-attached storage, or a cloud storage volume. PVs are used to provide persistent storage that can be dynamically claimed by Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs).

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: my-pv
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  storageClassName: manual
  hostPath:
    path: /data/my-pv
