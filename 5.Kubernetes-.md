**Kubernetes overview**

Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

**Kubernetes main Components**

1.Master Components:
These components manage the overall Kubernetes cluster.
kube-apiserver: The API server exposes the Kubernetes API and is the entry point for all control operations in the cluster.
etcd: A distributed key-value store used to store configuration data and state information for the entire cluster.
kube-scheduler: Responsible for assigning pods to nodes based on resource availability and constraints.
kube-controller-manager: Runs various control loops that regulate the state of the system. Examples include node controller, replication controller, and service account controller.
cloud-controller-manager: Integrates the cluster with the cloud provider's API, handling features like node provisioning, load balancing, and storage management.

2.Node Components:
These components run on each node and manage the containers and their associated resources.
kubelet: Communicates with the API server to ensure that containers are running in a pod. It manages the containers' lifecycle, monitors their health, and takes actions based on the desired state.
kube-proxy: Maintains network rules to manage network connectivity to and from pods.
Container Runtime: The software responsible for running containers, such as Docker, containerd, or CRI-O.

3.Add-ons:
Add-ons provide additional features and functionality to the Kubernetes cluster.
DNS (CoreDNS): Provides DNS-based service discovery for pods and services in the cluster.
Dashboard: A web-based graphical user interface for managing and monitoring the cluster.
Ingress Controller: Manages external access to services within the cluster using HTTP and HTTPS routing rules.
Monitoring and Logging: Various tools like Prometheus and Fluentd are used for monitoring and logging applications.
Networking Solutions: Plugins like Calico, Flannel, and Weave provide network connectivity between pods and nodes.

4.Persistent Storage:
Kubernetes provides various options for persistent storage.
Persistent Volumes (PV): Abstracts physical storage resources and provides a way to attach and manage them within pods.
Persistent Volume Claims (PVC): A request for a specific amount of storage with specific access modes. PVCs are used by pods to request storage.

**Kubernets list of key resources and concepts in Kubernetes:**

1.CPU (Central Processing Unit) : Represents the processing power allocated to containers. Measured in CPU units or cores.Managed using requests and limits in pod specifications.

2.Memory : Represents the RAM allocated to containers.Measured in bytes, with common suffixes (e.g., Mi, Gi) for megabytes and gigabytes.Managed using requests and limits in pod specifications.

3.Storage : Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) manage storage resources.Allows data to persist beyond pod lifecycle.

4.Pods : The smallest deployable units in Kubernetes.Can contain one or more containers that share network and storage resources.

5.Deployments : Manage the deployment and scaling of pods.Support rolling updates and rollbacks.

6.Services : Provide network connectivity to a set of pods.Allow load balancing and service discovery.

7.ConfigMaps and Secrets : ConfigMaps store configuration data that can be consumed by pods.Secrets store sensitive data like passwords and tokens.

8.Namespaces : Logical isolation of cluster resources. Allows multiple teams or applications to share a single cluster.

9.Nodes : Physical or virtual machines that run containers. Managed by the Kubernetes control plane.

10.Control Plane Components : Consists of components like kube-apiserver, etcd, kube-scheduler, and kube-controller-manager.Manages the overall state of the cluster.

11.Network Policies : Define how pods are allowed to communicate with each other.Enforce security and network segmentation.

12.Volumes : Allows data to be shared and persisted between containers and pods.Various types include emptyDir, hostPath, and cloud provider-specific volumes.

13.Ingress : Manages external access to services within the cluster. Routes traffic based on rules and hostnames.

14.DaemonSets : Ensures that a specific pod runs on all (or specific) nodes in the cluster.Useful for system daemons or monitoring agents.

15.StatefulSets : Manages the deployment of stateful applications with unique network identities and persistent storage.

16.Horizontal Pod Autoscaling : Automatically adjusts the number of replicas in a Deployment or ReplicationController based on resource utilization.

17.Vertical Pod Autoscaling : Adjusts the resource requests and limits of pods based on observed usage.

18.Pod Disruption Budgets : Define the number of pods that can be disrupted during voluntary disruptions.

19.Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) : Extend the Kubernetes API to support custom resources and controllers.

20.Metrics and Monitoring : Kubernetes provides integration with monitoring tools like Prometheus for collecting cluster and application metrics.
