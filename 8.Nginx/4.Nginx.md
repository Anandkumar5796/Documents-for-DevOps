**Nginx overview**

NGINX (pronounced "engine-x") is a popular open-source web server, reverse proxy server, and load balancer. It's known for its high performance, scalability, and flexibility, making it widely used for serving web content, managing traffic, and improving the performance of web applications.

Here are some key features and use cases of NGINX:

1.Web Server : NGINX can serve static and dynamic content over HTTP and HTTPS. It's often used to deliver web pages, images, stylesheets, JavaScript, and other assets to users' browsers.

2.Reverse Proxy : NGINX can act as a reverse proxy, which means it can sit between clients and backend servers (such as application servers or other web servers). It forwards requests from clients to the appropriate backend server and returns the responses back to the clients. This helps to improve security, load balancing, and performance.

3.Load Balancer : NGINX can distribute incoming traffic across multiple backend servers to balance the load and prevent overload on any one server. It ensures that requests are efficiently distributed to available servers, improving overall system performance and reliability.

4.Caching : NGINX supports caching of static content and responses from backend servers. Caching can significantly reduce the load on backend servers and improve response times for frequently accessed content.

5.Security: NGINX includes features like access control, SSL/TLS termination, and DDoS protection, helping to enhance the security of web applications.

6.HTTP/2 and TLS: NGINX supports the latest web protocols, including HTTP/2, which improves the speed and efficiency of loading web pages. It also provides SSL/TLS termination to enable secure communication between clients and servers.

7.Microservices: NGINX is often used in microservices architectures to manage and route traffic between different microservices, allowing for more flexible and scalable application deployments.

8.Content Delivery Network (CDN): NGINX can be used as part of a content delivery network to distribute content globally and reduce latency for users accessing web resources from different locations.

9.High Availability: NGINX's load balancing and failover capabilities contribute to building highly available systems by distributing traffic across multiple servers and ensuring continuity in case of server failures.

**Nginx installing**

sudo apt update : Before installing any software, it's a good practice to update the package list to make sure you're getting the latest available packages.
sudo apt install nginx : Use the following command to install NGINX:
sudo systemctl start nginx : After the installation is complete, start the NGINX service
sudo systemctl enable nginx : Enable Auto-Start: To ensure that NGINX starts automatically when the system boots up, enable the service
sudo systemctl status nginx : Check Status: You can verify that NGINX is running by checking its status

**Nginx Configuration**

To edit NGINX's configuration files, you can use a text editor like nano or vim. The main configuration file is usually located at /etc/nginx/nginx.conf, and individual site configurations can be found in the /etc/nginx/sites-available/ directory.
